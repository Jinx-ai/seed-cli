Allows for discovery of Seed compliant images hosted within a Docker registry (default is docker.io)

seed search [-r REGISTRY_NAME] [-o ORGANIZATION_NAME] [-f FILTER] [-u Username] [-p password]

*-r, -registry* ::
    Specifies a specific registry to search (default is index.docker.io).   
*-o, -org* ::
    Specifies a specific organization to filter (default is no filter).
*-f, -filter* ::
    Specifies a filter to apply (default is no filter).
*-u, -user* ::
    Username to login to remote registry (default is anonymous).
*-p, -password* ::
    Password to login to remote registry (default is anonymous).

*Note:* The Docker engine API does not support returning result sets of over 100 images due to no pagination capability. Until the API supports paginating over 100 results, the `seed search` command will only return a maximum of 100 seed image results. Furthermore, the docker engine search capability strips all special characters and will return images that contain any search term. Searching for foo-seed will return images with foo or seed in the name.
