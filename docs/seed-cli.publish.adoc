Publishes Seed compliant images to remote Docker registry

Provides a convenient way for algorithm developers to push a Seed image to a registry. This command will tag a seed image appropriately and push it to the specified registry. If successful, it will then remove the local image as well. 

Publishing will check if an image with the same name and tag exists in the registry and will fail if one is found unless either the force flag (-f) is set or a deconflict tag is specified to increase a version number. A common use case for seed algorithm developers is to publish new versions of their image and this can be done by specifying one of the job or package version flags. 

seed publish -in IMAGE_NAME [-r REGISTRY_NAME] [-o ORG_NAME] [-u username] [-p password] [Conflict Options]

*-in, -imageName* ::
    Specifies the Docker image name to publish; Must be an existing image residing on the local system.
*-r, -registry* ::
    Specifies a specific registry to publish the image (default is docker.io)
*-o, -org* ::
    Specifies a specific organization to publish the image under.
*-u, -user* ::
    Username to login if needed to publish images (default anonymous).
*-p, -password* ::
    Password to login if needed to publish images (default anonymous).
*-f* ::
    Forces overwrite of the remote image if publish conflict is found.

*CONFLICT OPTIONS* +
seed publish ... -f [-d SEED_DIRECTORY] [-pp] [-pm] [-P] [-jp] [-J]

If the force flag (-f) is not set, the following options specify how a publish conflict is handled:

*-d, -directory* ::
    Specifies the directory containing the seed.manifest.json and dockerfile to rebuild the image. 
*-pp* ::
    Force Patch version bump of 'packageVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-pm* ::
    Force Minor version bump of 'packageVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-P* ::
    Force Major version bump of 'packageVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-jp* ::
    Force Patch version bump of 'jobVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-jm* ::
    Force Minor version bump of 'jobVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-J* ::
    Force Major version bump of 'jobVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found

*EXAMPLE* +
This will build a new image example-0.2.0-seed:1.0.0 and publish it to hub.docker.com/geoint +

    seed publish -in example-0.1.3-seed:0.1.3 -r hub.docker.com -o geoint -jm -P

Deconfliction is obtained by incrementing the minor version number of the 'jobVersion' and the major version number of the 'packageVersion'.

*EXAMPLE:* + 
This is an example of updating the existing extractor image to 1.0.0 by forcing a major package version bump:

    seed publish -in extractor-0.1.0-seed:0.1.0 -r docker.io -o geoint -P

*EXAMPLE*:
This will rebuild the extractor image with the appropriate name & label and publish the image extractor-1.0.0-seed:1.0.0 to docker hub. Since the registry is private, a username and password is specified with the -u and -p options:

    seed publish -in extractor-0.1.0-seed:0.1.0 -r localhost:5000 -u testuser -p testpassword
