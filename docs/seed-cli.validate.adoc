Validates a Seed spec

The Validate command will validate a Seed json file against the Seed schema. This is also done as part of the build and run commands, but if a user is having problems getting their Seed file to validate this can be useful to debug without those additional steps. 

seed validate [-d MANIFEST_DIRECTORY] [-s SCHEMA_FILE]

*-d, -directory* ::
    Specifies the directory in which Seed is located (default is the current directory)
*-s, -schema* ::
    External Seed schema file; Overrides built in schema to validate Seed spec against

*EXAMPLE:* +
This command will validate the Seed file in the examples/extractor directory using the schema built-in to the Seed CLI tool:

seed validate -d examples/extractor

*EXAMPLE:* +
To use a different schema, pass it in using the -s flag: 

seed validate -d examples/extractor -s schema/0.1.0/seed.manifest.schema.json
