Builds Seed compliant Docker image

The first step when starting to package an algorithm for Seed compliance is to define the requirements and interface. This is done by a combination of execution environment configuration (Dockerfile), resource requirement definition and input / output specification (seed.manifest.json). By default, the seed build command assumes both a Dockerfile seed.manifest.json reside in the current working directory. Using these two files in conjunction the build command is able to construct an re-usable Seed compliant image.

seed build [-d JOB_DIRECTORY] [-c] [-D DOCKERFILE_DIRECTORY] [-m MANIFEST_DIRECTORY] [-u USER_NAME -p PASSWORD]

*-c, -cache-from* ::
    Utilizes the --cache-from option when building the docker image
*-d, -directory* ::
    Directory containing Seed spec and Dockerfile (default is current directory).
*-D, -dockerfile* ::
    Specifies the Dockerfile to use (default is Dockerfile within current directory)
*-m, -manifest* ::
    Specifies the seed manifest file to use (default is seed.manifest.json within the current directory)
*-v, -version* ::
    Version of built in seed manifest to validate against (default is 1.0.0).
*-u, -user* ::
    Username to login if needed to pull images (default anonymous).
*-p, -password* ::
    Password to login if needed to pull images (default anonymous).
*-publish* ::
    Will publish image after a successful build. May require extra arguments defined in the following sections

*EXAMPLE*: +
A simple example of this would be the addition-job image.

seed build -d examples/addition-job

This will result in a new Docker image that contains com.ngageoint.seed.manifest LABEL and is named according to spec constraint: addition-job-0.0.1-seed:1.0.0

This image can now be executed via the seed run command or pushed to a remote image registry by way of seed publish.

*BUILD AND PUBLISH OPTIONS:*
The seed build command also provides the option to automatically publish the image after building via they `-publish` flag. All flags specified by the `seed publish` command are available for use.

seed build [...] -publish -r REGISTRY -o ORGANIZATION [-f]

*-r,  -registry* ::
    Specifies a specific registry to publish the image (default is docker.io).
<<<<<<< HEAD
*-o, -org* ::
    Required argument that specifies a specific organization to publish the image under.
=======

*-o, -org* ::
    Required argument that specifies a specific organization to publish the image under.

>>>>>>> fb6a11231aab4b25e79657cd9054c4776462152e
*-f* ::
    Forces overwrite of the remote image if publish conflict is found.

*PUBLISH CONFLICT OPTIONS:*
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> fb6a11231aab4b25e79657cd9054c4776462152e
seed build [...] -publish -r REGISTRY -o ORGANIZATION [-f [-pp | -pm | -P | -jp | -jm | -JM ]]

If the force flag (-f) is not set, the following options specify how a publish conflict is handled: +

*-pp* ::
    Force Patch version bump of 'packageVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-pm* ::
    Force Minor version bump of 'packageVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-P* ::
    Force Major version bump of 'packageVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-jp* ::
    Force Patch version bump of 'jobVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-jm* ::
    Force Minor version bump of 'jobVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
*-JM* ::
    Force Major version bump of 'jobVersion' in manifest on disk if publish conflict found
